An educational tool created for refugee children learning English: a voice pronounces a random letter, and the user has to find the corresponding letter from a scrambled alphabet on the screen. Includes an upper-case mode and a lower-case mode. I was inspired to make this while working at a school for teenage students in Surrey, BC, with little to no English education. It is also one of my first projects made in React, which I am still getting the hang of.
